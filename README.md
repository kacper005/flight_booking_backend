## Important information about DB connection

This application is running the MySQL database in a Docker Container. Before starting the 
application you need to have Docker Desktop installed and running. When this is done, do the 
following steps in the IDE terminal:

1. Navigate to the "docker" folder in the project with `cd ./docker/`.
2. Run the command `docker compose up` to start the MySQL database. If this command has been run earlier, you can use `docker compose start` to start the container.
3. Run the `FlightBookingBackendApplication` class to start the application. 
4. To stop the docker container, run the command `docker compose stop` in the "docker" folder.
